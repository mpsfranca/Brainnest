# Personal-Budgeting-App
The goal of this project is to create a personal budgeting app that allows users to track their income and expenses, set budget goals, and view their spending habits.

Here are the steps you can take to create this project:

    Use the sqlite3 library to create a database to store the user's budget data.

    Use the tkinter library to create a GUI for the app, including widgets such as labels, buttons, text boxes and tables.

    Use the pandas library to manipulate the data and generate charts and tables to visualize the user's budget data.

    Use the datetime library to store and display the date and time of the transactions.
