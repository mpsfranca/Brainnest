# Weather App
## The goal of this project is to create a weather app that shows the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location. <br/>Here are the steps you can take to create this project:
> Use the requests library to make an API call to a weather service (e.g. OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve the weather data for a specific location. <br/>
> Use the json library to parse the JSON data returned by the API call. <br/>
> Use the tkinter library to create a GUI for the app, including widgets such as labels, buttons and text boxes. <br/>
> Use the Pillow library to display the weather icons. <br/>
> Use the datetime library to display the current time and date.
